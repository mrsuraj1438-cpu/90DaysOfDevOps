# 90 Days_Of_DevOps Journey
# Current Level 
I graduated with a B.Tech in CSE in 2025 and am currently preparing for DevOps roles.
I am also a  fresher for this journey.

## What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
DevOps is a culture and method that seeks to integrate the processes of software development and IT operations so that delivery of software is achieved within shorter timeframes and with greater reliability. It uses practices such as automation, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IAC), and continuous monitoring. Tools including Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, and Ansible play an integral role.

Cloud Engineering is the practice of designing, developing, and managing cloud-based infrastructure instead of relying on traditional data centres, with consideration given to scalability, high availability, cost optimisation and security, leveraging platforms such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to provide an on-demand, fault-tolerant and reproducible computing environment.

## Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
After graduation, I explored frontend tools like HTML, CSS, etc., and backend tools like Node.js and others. However, I realized I was not interested in frontend or backend development. One day, my cousin’s elder brother suggested, Why don’t you start a career in DevOps? After that, I started exploring this field, learning what DevOps is and how it works. I found it very interesting, which is why I chose DevOps as my career path.

## Where do you want to reach?
In the next 90 days, I want to:
1. I want to learn core DevOps tools like Linux, Docker, Shell Scripting, Cloud (AWS), Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and IAC (Terraform and Ansible).

2. First, I want to learn a simple project related to DevOps that will help me understand how DevOps works practically. After that, I want to build a project based on my own ideas.

3. After the 90-day DevOps challenge, I aim to learn these DevOps tools in depth, clear my fundamentals, and gain strong hands-on practice.

## How you will stay consistent every single day?
1. One thing I remember: these days will not come again, so this is a golden time for my future. That is why I want to stay consistent.

2. If I only focus on my goal of becoming a DevOps engineer, I may never reach it. But if I focus on the systems and tools (Linux, Docker, AWS, IAC, etc.), I can learn them in 90 days with strong hands-on practice, which will help me secure a DevOps role in a company.

3. I can also build a community by posting daily on LinkedIn and helping other community members, which will also help me grow.

## My 3 Goals for the Next 90 Days
1. Do daily assignments and tasks, and stay consistent, focusing on progress, not perfection.
2. First, learn how open-source projects work, and after that, I can also contribute to these projects.
3. Improve my communication and critical thinking, which can help me troubleshoot and solve problems effectively.

## 3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build
1. Linux and system troubleshooting with Shell Scripting – the building block of DevOps.
2. Docker and Kubernetes fundamentals
3. Cloud computing with AWS

## Time Commitment
Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours per day
Weekends: 4–5 hours per day

## Commitment(01-02-2026)
I complete my daily tasks even when I’m not in the mood to work, ensuring consistency every day.
This 90-day journey is not easy, and when tough times come, I remember this quote: “Pain is temporary, pride is forever.”
